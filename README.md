## Sensorless BLDC motor control on MCXA153
*The title should clearly indicate what the example code does. If the example is for an application note, then the document reference (e.g. AN12345) should be appended at the beginning.*

This application note demonstrates how to implement the six-step commutation control of brushless direct current(BLDC) motor on the MCXA family of MCUs. The NXP Freedom board FRDM-MC-LVBLDC
is used as a hardware platform for the motor
control reference solution. The hardware-dependent part of the motor control
software is addressed as well, including a detailed peripheral setup and driver
description. The FreeMASTER operation is also described in this document.<a name="RTF37303030393a204865616469"></a>

*Description should provide a clear explanation of what the code is for, and provide links to any related documentation. If documentation is included in the Github repo then its location should be mentioned here, along with the name of documentation file(s). If the code is a snippet/general software, then a sufficient description must be provided for a developer to fully understand the example, either in this readme or in another document in the repo.*

*If the code is an App SW pack then a link to the software summary page (SSP) on nxp.com must be provided.*

*If the code is a demo, then a link to any related videos on nxp.com.Youtube, and/or other related pages must be provided.*

*For training content you must reference the class training number (e.g. AMP-ENT-T4545), if available. You should also refer the reader to the training workbook and other materials from the class here.*

*Ask yourself - if you were finding this code for the first time, is there enough information to make it useful? Think **QUALITY**.*

## 1. Software<a name="step1"></a>
*In this section you should provide details of tools and software used (name and version.) Tool chain will already be a tag, but version information is needed. Also include any software that comes from outside of the SDK. Tell the reader where to find the software; for MCUXpresso tools you can reference https://nxp.com/mcuxpresso.*

## 2. Hardware<a name="step2"></a>
*In this section you should list hardware required to run the code, per the project file(s) that are included, with any relevant information about portability to other platforms.*

## 3. Setup<a name="step3"></a>
*For app notes and ap sw packs you can refer the reader to the documentation from the introduction here. For demos and code snippets/general code you should provide a description of how to build and run the code. Steps 1, 2, etc. can be added/deleted as appropriate.*

*For training content you would usually refer the reader to the training workbook here.*

### 3.1 Step 1
```
code snippet to copy/paste to project
```

### 3.2 Step 2

## 4. Results<a name="step4"></a>
*For app notes and ap sw packs you can refer the reader to the documentation from the introduction here, or just say "Not applicable for this example". For demos and code snippets/general code you should normally provide a description of what should happen when you run the code.*

*For training content you would usually refer the reader to the training workbook here.*

## 5. FAQs<a name="step5"></a>
*Include FAQs here if appropriate. If there are none, then state "No FAQs have been identified for this project".*

## 6. Support<a name="step6"></a>
